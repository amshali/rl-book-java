## The Reinforcement Learning(Sutton-Barto) Book Programming Exercises 

Projects are written in Java v15. You can find the exercises for each 
chapter in their respective folders with a little README on how to run them.

This is still a work in progress.

### Compile and package
In order to compile and create the jar file for the whole project run:
```shell
mvn clean compile package
```

### 15-puzzle 
For an implementation of 15-puzzle using RL see 
[15-puzzle README](src/main/java/com/github/amshali/rl/fifteen/README.md).
